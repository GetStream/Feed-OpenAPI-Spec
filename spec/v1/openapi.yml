    This is a documentation to Stream Activity Feed API written as OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
    The aim is to provide you with environment, where you can get quickly acquinted with the
    capabilities the API offers.

    In order to be able to perform requests to the API every HTTP request should contain the
    following authorization tokens:
    - **API key**
    - **JWT**

    Just click on the Authorize button and paste each token into corresponding input field.

    ### How to get your API key
    You can find the API key in your app's [dashboard](https://getstream.io/dashboard/).
    To create an app, you will need to create an account. Just visit our
    [website](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/).

    ### How to get a JWT
    You can generate the JWT at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).

    ### Server-Side Only endpoints
    In order to perform requests to endpoints marked as Server-Side Only, your token should
    have the admin level permissions set.

    You can control permissions by setting the following claims to JWT:
    - `"resource"`
    - `"action"`
    - `"feed_id"`

    Few examples follow.

    #### Permission to do anything anywhere
    ```
    {
      ...
      "resource": "*",
      "action": "*",
      "feed_id": "*"
      ...
    }
    ```

    #### Permission to do anything on activities
    ```
    {
      ...
      "resource": "activities",
      "action": "*",
      "feed_id": "*"
      ...
    }
    ```

    #### Permission to do anything on feed `user:SmithAnne`
    ```
    {
      ...
      "resource": "*",
      "action": "*",
      "feed_id": "user:SmithAnne"
      ...
    }
    ```

    #### Permission to write into feed `user:SmithAnne`
    ```
    {
      ...
      "resource": "*",
      "action": "write",
      "feed_id": "user:SmithAnne"
      ...
    }
    ```

    Otherwise just make sure that the token contains the `"user_id"` claim. That is an ID
    of an existing user in your application. That way you simulate a request done by one
    of your app's users. For example:
    ```
    {
      ...
      "user_id": "SmithAnne"
      ...
    }
    ```
